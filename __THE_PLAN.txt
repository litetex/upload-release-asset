GOALS:
* Modernize the project (base on actions/artifact-upload)
* Aims to fix the following issues:
  * [MAJOR] 47/28/11 - use wildcards in asset_path / upload from multiple assets / dynamic Filenames
  * [MAJOR] 50 - Fix doc
  * [MINOR] 13/PR 22 - Overwrite release asset
  * [MINOR] 10 - Upload (directly) from artifact

CHANGES:
* Fixed in/outputs: bla_bla -> bla-bla 
  * this format is used in e.g. setup-node, upload-artifact and like everywhere else in actions
* Added search with wildcards

TODO:
* Implement release functionally (like artifacts did in https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/artifact)
* Consider PR 22
* Add tests
* Create dist/... stuff
* Deploy standalone? - just to really test all that stuff
* Recreate/Restore workflows
* Update Docs (Readme and stuff)
* Remove this :D
